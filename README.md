# AndroidPocketSphinxPoC
Android speech recognition PocketSphinx (NL and EN) Proof of Concept. This PoC shows PocketSphinx speech recognition. The database for recognition is set up on the phone, so the app should without an Internet connection. Because of this configuration, the dictionairy contains a limited number of words. The app will offer a list of words to choose from. After you pronounce one of the words in the list, it will show the recognized word. Setting up PocketSphinx is not really straight forward. If you need the source code, please send me an e-mail. I'm happy to share my findings. I've added a Dutch language model and dictionairy to proof that PocketSphinx is able to work with this language as well. Learn more about PocketSphinx on https://github.com/cmusphinx/pocketsphinx.  Please note: to get the best results, be sure that you use the app in quiet surroundings.  SPECIAL BONUS: I've included two easter-egg words in the app, one in English and one in Dutch. If you say the easter-egg word, you will know ;) .. Please leave a comment if you found it, not spoiling the fun for other easter egg hunters, of course. Happy hunting! :)Read more on http://happyworx.nl/blog
